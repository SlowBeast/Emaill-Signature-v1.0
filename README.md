# Emaill-Signature-v1.0
HTML Email Signature which I created for the school I am worked with and I used only HTML. This will be changed to a new design if the school asks for another design in the near future. The name of the school and other information related to it has been removed due to ensure anonymity. (Basic Email signature using HTML and CSS)
